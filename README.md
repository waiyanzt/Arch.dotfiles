# Arch Linux Dotfiles

This repository contains configuration files for my two Arch Linux setups:

1. **Lenovo ThinkPad T14(Gen 5)** - Running Hyprland on Wayland.
2. **Desktop PC(Nvidia GPU)** - Running i3wm on Xorg.

The repo is structured to manage configs for both systems, while accounting for some overlap (e.g., `nvim`).
